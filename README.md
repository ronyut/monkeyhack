<i>Let's inject JavaScript into websites to make life better!</i>

<b>What is this project?</b><br>
Some sites are very UX/UI-wise unfriendly, but we are going to change this by injecting JS into this websites.

<b>For example:</b><br>
You are watching a lecture on YouTube and you're really trying to concentrate, but there's a coll video on the left side that seems super funny, so you end up clicking on it and wasting your precious time instead of studying.<br>
Frustrating, isn't it?

<b>So here's the solution:</b><br>
A script that removes all unrelated videos on YouTube, so they won't disturb you while you're trying to concntrate.<br>
That means: No more distraction while you're studying.<br>
How does that sound to you? ;)<br>

And there are more!

# install
1. Go to Chrome Store and download the `tampermonkey` extension.
2. After installed, go the the extenstion's dashboard, simply by right clicking on the extension's icon that is located in the top of Chrome browser, right next to the settings button.
3. Click on the `+` button to add a new script.
4. Go back to my github repository, copy on of the scripts here that you find relevant for you, and paste inside the script window from step #3. 
5. Save the script (Ctrl + S)
6. Close Chrome (I recommend also killing chrome task in task manager)
7. Open Chrome and enjoy!
